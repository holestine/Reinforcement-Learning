# ### 3. Take Random Actions in the Environment
# 
# In the next code cell, you will learn how to use the Python API to control the agent and receive feedback from the environment.
# 
# Note that **in this coding environment, you will not be able to watch the agent while it is training**, and you should set `train_mode=True` to restart the environment.

# ### 4. It's Your Turn!
# 
# Now it's your turn to train your own agent to solve the environment!  A few **important notes**:
# - When training the environment, set `train_mode=True`, so that the line for resetting the environment looks like the following:
# ```python
# env_info = env.reset(train_mode=True)[brain_name]
# ```
# - To structure your work, you're welcome to work directly in this Jupyter notebook, or you might like to start over with a new file!
# You can see the list of files in the workspace by clicking on **_Jupyter_** in the top left corner of the notebook.
# - In this coding environment, you will not be able to watch the agent while it is training.  
# However, **_after training the agent_**, you can download the saved model weights to watch the agent on your own machine!
